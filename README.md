# Getting Started
I've chosen **yarn** as a package manager. no reasons, I just freaking love it. you can use **npm** as well.

## Installation

```
yarn 
```

## Build and Run

```
yarn frontend:dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the results.

You can start editing the page by modifying `packages/frontend/src/pages/index.tsx`
